          <h2>Shirting</h2>
          <h5 id="heading13">Shirting Fit</h5>
 <p id="text13" style="display:none;">We worked hard to create the perfect-fitting shirt. We design our shirts (and jackets) based on the principle that when a shirt fits the chest well, this lays the foundation for a better-fitting shirt overall.

   Tailoring to chest circumference provides a trimmer fit to the body. A higher arm hole allows for the sleeve to be tailored in appearance, rather than baggy. We think we nailed down a tail length that looks smart both tucked and untucked.</p>
          <h5 id="heading14">Shirting Repair</h5>
          <p id="text14" style="display:none;"> We only want our stuff to be around for the Long Haul and so with that said, we think its important to provide repair service. If your shirting rips or anything happens that necessitates repair we'll be more than happy to help you with the fix. However, we always recommend getting your shirt repaired locally. By getting your shirt repaired locally, not only are you supporting your local economy, but you're reducing your carbon foot print as well. If you're not sure where to start with finding someone to repair your gear, we recommend checking out your local tailors, seamstress, or cleaners. You can also give us a shout and we can help you find someone to get your shirt back into fighting shape. 
 
           Repairs
           
           Please just write us to let us know if you need a repair. In your email to hello@taylorstitch.com, include your name, order number, and the reason for repair. Final and most important step: attach at least one image of the affected area so that we can determine the best course of treatment. Upon receiving your repair request, we’ll provide you with a lead time for repair and give you a quote if necessary.
           
           Please note that per California State law and common decency, garments sent in for repair must be clean, so please launder your garment before to mailing it.
           
           Buttons
           
           Buttons sometimes can crack or fall off with use and washing/drying. While we make an effort to have all of our buttons available to get you replacements, there are sometimes certain buttons that we don't have available. With this said, if we don't have the buttons you need, any tailor always has a vast array of buttons and can usually match up pretty good for you. 
           
           </p>
          <h5 id="heading15">Custom Shirt Style Options</h5>
          <p id="text15" style="display:none;"> Gambert offers a wide array of styles for dress shirts; from spread collars to button downs and all in between there are a ton of options and they specialize in primarily lighter weight dress shirt fabrics using single needle construction. To get a sense of all style offerings, take a look here at their site. This will help you be prepared for the decisions you’ll need to make in-store. 
 
           Lastly, if you’ve got a fabric you’d like to use for your shirt, you’re welcome to show us, and if it's a weight that Gambert's sewing machines are able to accommodate, we'll use it! When we say custom, we mean it. If you’ve got any other questions, just reach out and let us know.  hello@taylorstitch.com. </p>
          <h2>Footwear</h2>
           <h5 id="heading16">Footwear Products</h5>
          <p id="text16" style="display:none;"> 
           As you wear your Taylor Stitch shoes or boots day in and day out, we want them to age gracefully, just like you. Just like you take care of yourself, its a good idea to take care of your footwear. How do you do this, and from the thousands of products out there, which do we recommend to help you keep your investment in the best condition possible.  See below for some simple recommendations that will go a long way in giving your shoes the extra life you're looking for: 
           
           Shoe Trees - They don't need to be fancy, just Cedar.  Shoe trees will keep the shape, keep your shoes from stinking, and generally keep them the way you want them.  You don't need the best and we've seen them as low as $15.00 for a pair.  
           
           Leather Conditioner - You don't need to do this often nor within the first year or two, but eventually the leather will begin to dry out and you will want to use leather conditioner to keep the leather of the uppers moisturized to prevent dry rot.  Otter Wax makes a good one that we like to recommend.  
           
           Suede Waterproofing - Waterproofing suede is always a good extra line of defense if you're so inclined, but know that with our Weatherproof Suede the waterproofing is impregnated into the leather and will last the life of the shoe where-as topical coatings will wear off over time. 
           
           Shoe Polish - Not necessary for all of our shoes, but for those that you want to keep looking fresh vs. developing that heady patina you saw in the photos, we think its a great idea and recommend finding the closest color match out of the array that Kiwi sells.  
           
           A Damp Rag - Seriously, a damp rag goes a long way. If you're the type to beat your boots to death, give them a sponge bath every now and again. Dirt, salt, and mud take their toll on a shoe and a quick clean up goes a long way. While you're at it, why not rub in some leather conditioner when you're done, your daily drivers will thank you.  
           
           Have any other questions, we're more than happy to help.  Drop us a line at hello@taylorstitch.com and we'll get back to you as fast as we can.  </p>

           <h2>Bottoms</h2>
          
           <h5 id="heading18">Washing Denim</h5>
           <p id="text18" style="display: none;"> When should I wash my denim?
 
             There are a lot of theories out there about how to best care for raw denim. We like to keep things simple: wash your jeans when they start to smell or feel greasy. Nobody appreciates smelly jeans, and a buildup of dirt speeds up the breakdown of the fibers in the fabric. Neither are good for your jeans.  On the other side of the coin, jeans don't need to be washed after every wear, weekly, or even monthly and over washing will cause the break down of fibers just like dirt.  Back to the rule of thumb, just wash when they start to get a funk and you should be good; this is different for everyone and the amount they wear their denim and activities they do in them.  
             
             How do I wash my denim?
             
             When washing your jeans, start by turning them inside out. Fill a bucket or your bathtub with cool water, and stir in some mild detergent (Woolite Dark works great). Fully submerge your jeans into the water, gently moving them around to fully soak them. Let them sit for thirty minutes. When you remove the jeans from the water, give them a rinse with some cold water and then press the fabric (do not wring) to get the majority of the water out. From here, hang your jeans to dry (a drying rack or shower rod will do) and you are good to go. </p>
            
             <h5 id="heading19"> What is the inseam of your pants?</h5>
             <p id="text19" style="display: none;">All our pants come in inseam 34" to accommodate all sizes. If you need, you can always have your pants hemmed. </p>
           <h2>Materials</h2>
           <h5 id="heading20">Where is your cotton sourced from?</h5>
           <p id="text20" style="display: none;">Our organic cotton is sourced from farms in the eastern provinces of Shanxi/ Zhejiang/ Jiangsu/ or Henan. Our cotton is not sourced from the province of Xinjiang.</p>
           <h5 id="heading21">How Do I Re-Wax My Jacket?</h5>
           <p id="text21" style="display: none;">For dry wax, we recommend using Nikwax TX.Direct Spray-on Waterproofing Spray. Spray the wax on the entirety of the jacket. Be sure to give special attention to areas of high wear, such as elbows, pockets, and seams. Let the Nikwax spray dry and you’re good to go.
 
             For wet wax, we recommend Otter Wax Heavy Duty Fabric Wax. Rub the wax over your garment until you have an even coat. Pay special attention to any seams, pockets, and other areas of high wear. Wipe off any particularly thick areas of coating. Use a heat gun or hair dryer on low heat to melt the wax and bind it with the fabric. Let dry overnight in a well-ventilated room. </p>
            
             <h5 id="heading22"> How can i care for my leather boots?</h5>
             <p id="text22" style="display: none;"> The best way to care for your boots is to be proactive with your care. To be proactive we recommend Otter Wax Leather Salve. This salve prevents the leather from becoming waterlogged and then drying out and damaging the leather. Additionally, wax protects from stains you may otherwise pick up from kicking around town.</p>
             <h5 id="heading23"> What is DWR Coating?</h5>
             <p id="text23" style="display: none;">Durable Water Repellency, or DWR, is a treatment for fabrics that creates water repellency. When water comes into contact with DWR, it will bead up and roll off the surface. Although the fabric is waterproof, DWR benefits by allowing breathability and doesn’t trap in heat as much as a waxed garment might. While DWR treatments are necessary for many parts of our life, they unfortunately contain perfluorochemicals (PFCs), which have significant environmental and health impacts.
 
               DWR is composed of carbon chains that help prevent things like oil, water, and stains from sticking to the fabric. Many of these carbon chains do not break down and remain in the environment, especially DWR treatments that use a long chain C8 fluorocarbon. 
               
               Our solution has been to use a C6 carbon chain that dilutes in the water quicker and is less mobile in the environment than C8. This solution is not perfect and we will continue to search for better alternatives. If you’re looking for something that is free of DWR yet still has some weatherproofing, please check out our waxed gear.</p>

            <p id="text29" style="display: none;">You may exchange or return any product for a full refund or store credit within 21 days of having received it. The 21 day period for Workshop items begins on the day the product is delivered to you. Once you have initiated a return, you have 28 days to ship it or you'll lose your refund and the shipping label will expire. To be clear, you have 21 days after receiving the product to initiate a return and 28 days after it is initiated to get it in the mail.

              However, there are some exceptions: we know that certain items like raw denim, footwear, and dress shirts require a little more than a quick try-on. That said, just be respectful. If the product doesn’t work out, remember that we hope to sell these to someone who is equally as excited as you. 
              
              Last Call items are final sale and are non-returnable. 
              
               
              
              ** Please note **
              
              Items purchased during sales are eligible for a return or exchange. Last Call items remain final sale and are non-returnable. 
              
              Only items that are unworn, unwashed, unaltered, free or stains and odors, and that have their original tags affixed with be eligible for return or exchange.
              
              If an exchange has been granted and your original item is not sent back to us, you will be charged for both items. Similarly, if your return item does not meet the aforementioned standards for New condition, we reserve the right to withhold your refund.</p>

        <h2>Workshop</h2>
      <h5 id="heading30">How does the Workshop work?</h5>
      <p id="text30" style="display: none;">At the beginning of each month, we release a newly designed collection in the Workshop. For an entire month, these products are available to pre-order at a discounted price.

        By purchasing these products before they enter production, you as our customer assist us in funding the production process. Products that reach their funding goal are manufactured and delivered. At the close of each campaign, customers will be notified of what they can expect next in return for their participation. </p>
      <h5 id="heading31">What is the Workshop?</h5>
      <p  id="text31" style="display: none;">The Workshop is our crowd-funding model for new products. It’s one of the many things that make us different.</p>
    <h5 id="heading32">How long is a funding period for a product?</h5>
    <p id="text32" style="display: none;">Whenever we launch a new product in the Workshop it will be available to pre-order/fund at a discount for one month. This allows us to gauge popularity of a product so that we can determine how much of it to make. Taking orders before we produce also helps fund the production process. 

      After the collection has been live for one month, we close the funding period and the product will no longer be available to purchase while the garments are being made. Workshop garments will once again be available to order, no longer at their discounted pre-sale price, once they arrive at our facility, about 8-10 weeks from the close of their funding period.</p>
